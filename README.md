# TS-Scavenger3_Essentials_SignCommands
this was requested by [ pacenadhif777 ] 
original plugin: https://github.com/Scavenger3/Essentials-SignCommands.git

- to update this im planning to not change this plugin much as i want to leave the way it is

- so this plugin is where you easily execute a command using a sign

- ive tested this plugin it works in weird way possible but its decent
> start by placing a sign then put `[Sign Command]` you can change that in config file if i know
> next is type the prefix which is `>` can also change in config file
> now you can do like `>spawnmob 1 1`
>
> to execute the sign command you have to interact or try to destroy it
>
> to completely destroy it you need to type `/destsign` and have a pickaxe that destroy a sign in 1 tap
